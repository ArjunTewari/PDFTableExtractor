The effective tax rate in any quarter may be subject to fluctuations during the year as new information is obtained, which may positively or negatively affect the assumptions used to estimate the annual effective tax rate, including factors such as valuation allowances against deferred tax assets, the recognition or de-recognition of tax benefits related to uncertain tax position, if any, and changes in or the interpretation of tax laws in jurisdictions where the Company conducts business.', rows=None, bBox=BBox(x=81.0, y=80.97, w=435.0, h=707.0)), PageItem(type='heading', lvl=1, value='Performance Indicators', md='# Performance Indicators', rows=None, bBox=BBox(x=81.0, y=80.97, w=3.0, h=78.0)), PageItem(type='table', lvl=None, value=None, md='| in millions except ARPPC                            | Q4 2024  | Q4 2023  | YoY  |\\n| --------------------------------------------------- | -------- | -------- | ---- |\\n| Monthly Active Users (MAU) - Global5                | 79.6     | 61.4     | 30 % |\\n| U.S.                                                | 43.7     | 36.8     | 19 % |\\n| International                                       | 36.0     | 24.6     | 46 % |\\n| ANN                                                 | 2.7      | 2.0      | 35 % |\\n| Paying Circles - Global6                            | 2.3      | 1.8      | 25 % |\\n| U.S.                                                | 1.6      | 1.3      | 23 % |\\n| International                                       | 0.6      | 0.5      | 33 % |\\n| Average Revenue per Paying Circle (ARPPC)7,8        | $ 131.76 | $ 124.17 | 6 %  |\\n| Life360 Consolidated Subscriptions9                 | 2.9      | 2.4      | 19 % |\\n| Average Revenue per Paying Subscription (ARPPS)8,10 | $ 110.43 | $ 102.17 | 8 %  |\\n| Net hardware units shipped11                        | 1.9      | 1.7      | 8 %  |\\n| Average Selling Price (ASP)12,13                    | $ 12.56  | $ 11.50  | 9 %  |\\n| Annualized Monthly Revenue (AMR)                    | $ 367.6  | $ 274.1  | 34 % |', rows=[['in millions except ARPPC', 'Q4 2024', 'Q4 2023', 'YoY'], ['Monthly Active Users (MAU) - Global5', '79.6', '61.4', '30 %'], ['U.S.', '43.7', '36.8', '19 %'], ['International', '36.0', '24.6', '46 %'], ['ANN', '2.7', '2.0', '35 %'], ['Paying Circles - Global6', '2.3', '1.8', '25 %'], ['U.S.', '1.6', '1.3', '23 %'], ['International', '0.6', '0.5', '33 %'], ['Average Revenue per Paying Circle (ARPPC)7,8', '$ 131.76', '$ 124.17', '6 %'], ['Life360 Consolidated Subscriptions9', '2.9', '2.4', '19 %'], ['Average Revenue per Paying Subscription (ARPPS)8,10', '$ 110.43', '$ 102.17', '8 %'], ['Net hardware units shipped11', '1.9', '1.7', '8 %'], ['Average Selling Price (ASP)12,13', '$ 12.56', '$ 11.50', '9 %'], ['Annualized Monthly Revenue (AMR)', '$ 367.6', '$ 274.1', '34 %']], bBox=BBox(x=84.0, y=80.97, w=431.0, h=678.71)), PageItem(type='heading', lvl=1, value='FY', md='# FY', rows=None, bBox=BBox(x=399.0, y=548.97, w=62.0, h=9.0)), PageItem(type='table', lvl=None, value=None, md='| in millions                                                              | FY 2024  | FY 2023  | YoY   |\\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | -------- | ----- |\\n| Average Revenue per Paying Circle (ARPPC)7,8                             | $ 128.00 | $ 121.09 | 6 %   |\\n| Life360 Consolidated Average Revenue per Paying Subscription (ARPPS)8,10 | $ 106.16 | $ 99.53  | 7 %   |\\n| Net hardware units shipped11                                             | 3.9      | 4.0      | (4) % |\\n| Average Selling Price (ASP)12,13                                         | $ 13.72  | $ 13.48  | 2 %   |', rows=[['in millions', 'FY 2024', 'FY 2023', 'YoY'], ['Average Revenue per Paying Circle (ARPPC)7,8', '$ 128.00', '$ 121.09', '6 %'], ['Life360 Consolidated Average Revenue per Paying Subscription (ARPPS)8,10', '$ 106.16', '$ 99.53', '7 %'], ['Net hardware units shipped11', '3.9', '4.0', '(4) %'], ['Average Selling Price (ASP)12,13', '$ 13.72', '$ 13.48', '2 %']], bBox=BBox(x=84.0, y=80.97, w=431.0, h=566.0)), PageItem(type='text', lvl=None, value='Note: The financial information in this announcement may not add or recalculate due to rounding.
